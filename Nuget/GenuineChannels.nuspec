    <title>Genuine Channels for .NET Remoting</title>
    <summary>Genuine Channels is a high-end transport environment accessible through .NET Remoting and Direct eXchange Manager (DXM) API.</summary>
    <description>Genuine Channels is a high-end transport environment accessible through .NET Remoting and Direct eXchange Manager (DXM) API. Besides offering steady connections in any environment thanks to configurable reconnect feature, Genuine Channels support communication with clients located behind firewalls, NAT and proxy servers (including those requiring authorization). Data encryption managed by security sessions and data compression without installing sinks provide for both easier coding and fast and secure client-server communication.</description>
