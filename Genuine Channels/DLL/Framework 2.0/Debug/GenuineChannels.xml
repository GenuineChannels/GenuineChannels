            I would recommend to set a large value (for example, 100) in this case.
            Remember, each time the receiver sends successful response, counter for this receiver is resetted to zero.

            That is as soon as a true broadcast sender will not be able to deliver a message 
            consecutively for this number of tries to the specific receiver, it will automatically
            start sending messages to this specific receiver via the usual channel.
            Set it to zero to prevent switching to simulation mode.
            I would recommend to set a large value (for example, 100) in this case.
            Remember, each time the receiver sends successful response to the message sent via 
            true multicast channel, this counter is resetted to zero and receiver is switched back
            to normal mode when messages are delivered via "true" multicast channel.
